📱💬 Power-up-messaging Microservice

This microservice is part of a project to manage a food court. It allows sending messages to the customer's cellphone 📲📩 using Twilio, with information related to the order they placed at one of the restaurants in the food court. A MySQL database is used to store the relevant data.
